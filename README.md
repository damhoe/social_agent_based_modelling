# Social agent based modelling
Project to facilitate the modelling of (social) agent-based models of social questions based on [Agents.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/Agents.jl).
## Aim:
Basic influence factors on decisions like agents rational decision, opinion, information about opinion and decisions of neighbours, etc. are combined in an integrated framework to model societal decision dynamics.
## Usage:
Very first prototype of model can be found in [/vehicle_choice_model](https://github.com/lquante/social_agent_based_modelling/tree/master/vehicle_choice_model).

Running [exampleScripts.jl](https://github.com/lquante/social_agent_based_modelling/blob/master/vehicle_choice_model/exampleScript.jl) allows some interactive simulations to familiarize yourself with the general model setup.
